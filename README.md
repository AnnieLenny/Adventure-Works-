# Adventure Works Sales & Profit Margin Analysis Project 📊

## Project Overview 🎯

In this project, I explored and analysed the **Adventure Works** dataset with the goal of uncovering trends in **sales**, **profit margin**, and **quantity** across different dimensions such as **country** and **category**. Using **Power BI**, to create dynamic and interactive **visualizations** to make the data insights more accessible and actionable.

## Key Objectives 🎯

- **Sum of Sales & Profit Margin by Month**: Analyze and visualize the sum of sales and profit margin by month.
- **Sales Analysis by Country & Category**: Use a **stacked column bar chart** to visualize sales across different countries and product categories.
- **Quantity Analysis by Category**: Explore and visualize the sum of quantity sold by product category.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create dashboards with slicers, legends, and filters to allow users to interact with the data and explore various insights.

## Step-by-Step Approach 📝

### 2. **Sales & Profit Margin by Month** 📅
- Calculate the **sum of sales** and **profit margin** for each month.
- Visualize this data using a **line chart** to reveal trends over time.
- Add a **legend** to differentiate between sales and profit margin.

#### Result:

- The line chart provides clear insights into **seasonal trends** and **profit fluctuations**.

### 3. **Sales Analysis by Country & Category** 🌍

- Use a **stacked column bar chart** to analyze **sales by country** and **category**.
- The **categories** are represented as different color segments within each column, making it easier to compare sales across both countries and categories.
- Add **legends** and **tooltips** to enhance the readability and user interaction.

#### Result:

- A stacked bar chart that effectively shows the contribution of each product category to sales across countries.

### 4. **Quantity Analysis by Category** 📦

- Visualize the **sum of quantity sold** by product category using a **bar chart**.
- This visualization highlights which categories contribute the most to the total quantity sold.
- Use slicers to allow users to filter the data by other dimensions like **year** or **product line**.

#### Result:

- A clear view of which categories are most popular in terms of quantity sold.

### 5. **Interactivity & Formatting** 🎨

- Add **interactive slicers** to allow users to filter by **year**, **product category**, and **region**.
- Use **legends** and **formatting** to make the visuals more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.
- Apply color themes and adjust chart styles to ensure clarity and ease of use.

#### Result:

- Interactive visuals that engage users and let them explore the data on their own.

## Final Dashboard 🖥️

- The final dashboard includes multiple **visualizations**, with clear legends, slicers, and interactive features.
- Users can easily interact with the charts to explore different insights based on their preferences (e.g., comparing sales trends, analyzing profit margins, etc.).
